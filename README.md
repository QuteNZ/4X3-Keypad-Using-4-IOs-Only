# 4X3-Keypad-Using-4-IOs-Only
A typical MxN matrix keypad usually takes M+N IOs for interfacing to a microcontroller. This novelty configuration uses diodes to loop from Rows to Columns to reduce the IOs down to M, suppose M >N. This instruction will demonstrate how to use it with Arduino in case numbers of IO are in your concern in your project.
